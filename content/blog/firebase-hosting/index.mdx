Almost anytime you want to share a new trick or showcase something, you will need a way to host your web pages or app. Firebase Hosting can help you.

### What is Firebase Hosting?

As the Firebase Hosting [docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) mention:

> Firebase Hosting provides fast and secure hosting for your web app, static and dynamic content, and microservices.

So, whether you have some static HTML/CSS, a reactjs, vuejs, or svelte app, you can use Firebase Hosting to deploy your code to a global CDN.

### How to get started?

**Step 1:** Install the Firebase cli, here I'm using _npm_ ([check the docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) for other methods):

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

**Step 2:** Login to your account using the Firebase cli:

```bash
firebase login
```

This should redirect you to a web page to login into your account (create one if you don't have it already). Once logged in, you should see a "Login successful" message in your terminal.

**Step 3:** Init a firebase project

This step involves linking your project (the code you want to deploy) to a firebase project. You can use an existing project or create a new one.

To do this, let's run:

```bash
firebase init hosting
```

The CLI will prompt us to "Use an existing project" or to "Create a new project", among other options. For me, I'll create a new project.

After following the steps, we should have some new files. `.firebaserc` contains the project id. The `firebase.json` file has the hosting config; public folder and other things. You will also notice a `404.html` page that is created by default by Firebase (if you don't already have one in your project).

```diff
+ .firebaserc
+ 404.html
+ firebase.json
```

These first three steps are identical regardless of your project type; Static HTML, reactjs, vuejs, or svelte app, etc ...

## **Deploying static HTML**

In the case of a static HTML project, I created a project with only one `index.html` file [here](https://github.com/omarhoumz/wr-firebase-hosting/blob/main/static-html/index.html). You can clone it to follow along.

### **Step 4: Deploy**

Now, we can deploy our website (our index.html in this case) to Firebase Hosting using this:

```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

If the deployment is successful, you should see the URL to your newly deployed website in your terminal. It should be in this format: `<project-id>.web.app`

For me, this is the URL I ended up with [wr-firebase-hosting.web.app](http://wr-firebase-hosting.web.app).

Check the whole static HTML project here: [https://github.com/omarhoumz/wr-firebase-hosting/tree/main/static-html](https://github.com/omarhoumz/wr-firebase-hosting/tree/main/static-html)

## Create-React-App app

I created a CRA sample app here: [https://github.com/omarhoumz/wr-firebase-hosting/tree/main/firebase-is-fire-cra](https://github.com/omarhoumz/wr-firebase-hosting/tree/main/firebase-is-fire-cra)

### Step 4: build our project:

We can build our CRA app using:

```bash
npm run build
```

This is will create a `build` folder. And this is the folder we should deploy to Firebase. But how to tell Firebase about it? Good question.

Remember the `firebase.json` file? We need to change the `"public"` key in that config file from whatever it is now to `"build"`, like so:

```diff
- "public": "public",
+ "public": "build",
```

### Step 5: Deploy

Now we are all set to deploy our CRA app to firebase.

```diff
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

And again, if the deployment is successful, you should see the URL to your newly deployed website in your terminal. It should be in this format `<project-id>.web.app` .

For me, this is the URL I ended up with [wr-firebase-hosting-cra.web.app](http://wr-firebase-hosting-cra.web.app).

You'll the whole project here: [https://github.com/omarhoumz/wr-firebase-hosting/tree/main/firebase-is-fire-cra](https://github.com/omarhoumz/wr-firebase-hosting/tree/main/firebase-is-fire-cra)

## NextJs app

NextJs handles hybrid static & server rendering. And many more features. Firebase Hosting allows only to host static files. However, we can go around it by using [Firebase Cloud Function](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) and do some [fancy Hosting rewrites](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/full-config#rewrites).

### SSG content

We'll need to build and "export" our next app

```bash
# yarn
yarn build && yarn export

# npm
npm run build && npm run export
```
